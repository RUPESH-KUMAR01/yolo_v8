# YOLOv8 Custom Object Detection

This repository is a customized version of the Ultralytics YOLOv8 code, tailored specifically for object detection. The original YOLOv8 implementation by Ultralytics supports multiple image tasks such as segmentation, pose estimation, and oriented bounding boxes. However, this repository focuses solely on object detection, simplifying the code and making it easier to read and modify.

## Features

- Simplified code for easier readability and modification.
- Removed support for segmentation, pose estimation, and oriented bounding boxes to focus on object detection.
- Easier to modify the model structure without parsing through YAML files.

## Development Goals

1. **Model Development:**
    - Implement a straightforward model development approach using the `Sequential` function. This will make it easier to read and change the structure of the model.
